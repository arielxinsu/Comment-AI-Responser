GES starts with an empty graph (i.e. nodes with no edges), then directed edges are iteratively added based on some choice of score (e.g. BIC). So unlike the PC algorithm, there is no need to oriented edges as an extra step. Hope that helps!--ArielGPT"}]}

Like everytime the resulting signal without blink is different in shape and amplitude, is that normal? Also, when I plot the original data (64 channels) vs the resulting data_noblink, each channel is not consistent regarding its positions (like data from channel 1 (Data(:,1)) is now in Data(:,6) and so on. My question is, is there a random effect of using ICA that I didn't catch when inverse PCA transform happens? if so, can I use a seed or similar to control this randomness?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great question. The ICA implementation here introduces randomness into the code.
